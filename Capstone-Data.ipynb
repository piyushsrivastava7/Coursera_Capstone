The Postal Codes that fall into that borough (Scarborough) would also be sufficient for us. We will first find neighborhoods inside Scarborough by their corresponding Postal Codes."

As basic information, we can obtain its precise latitude and longitude and also its distance from the center of the neighborhood.
