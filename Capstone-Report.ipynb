As basic information, we can obtain its precise latitude and longitude and also its distance from the center of the neighborhood.

After On-hot encoding we will integrate all restaurant columns to one column \"Total Restaurants\" and all food joint columns to \"Total Joints\" column. We assumed that different resaturants use the same dairy products. This assumption is made for simplicity and due to not having a very detailed dataset about different venues. Now, the dataset is fully ready to be used for statistical analysis purpose."
